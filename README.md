# Predicting-Heart-Rate-using-python

The main aim of this project is to have the ability to predict the Heart Rate of an individual using Exercise Data. We will utilise Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook along with a range of statistical modules such as stats models and patsy to complete the analysis. This dataset was collected from the OpenML website and the URL is https://www.openml.org/d/41937 (Nada Hamdy,2019). The report has the following contents listed by the "Table of Contents" section.

Overview: This section will explain the dataset and state the main objective of the project.
Data Preparation: This section will show steps of eliminating unnecessary contents that interfere with the analysis.
Data Exploration: This section will dig deeper and highlight the relationships within the dataset.
Statistical Modelling and Performance Evaluation: This crucial section will use all the available features to predict the target characteristic using the full model. Then using p-values for backwards variable selection to achieve the reduced model, another check is done using the new model.
Summary and Conclusions: This final section summarises our work and showcases the findings of the project.
